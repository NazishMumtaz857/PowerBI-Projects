This Power BI project presents an in-depth sales analysis of a fictional pizza business using one year of transaction data. The aim of this report is to uncover sales patterns, customer preferences, and profitability trends by analyzing and visualizing data from multiple related CSV files.

**Data Sources:**

The project is built using the following cleaned and transformed CSV files:

1- orders.csv – Contains order-level information with timestamps.

2- order_details.csv – Breaks down each order by pizza type and quantity.

3- pizzas.csv – Links pizza names to their category and size.

4- pizza_types.csv – Provides the name, ingredients, and category for each pizza type.

**Data Cleaning & Preparation:**

Data was cleaned and transformed in Power Query before being loaded into the Power BI data model. This included:

--Handling missing or inconsistent values.

--Standardizing date/time formats.

--Creating relationships between tables.

--Adding calculated columns and measures (e.g., total price, profit margins).

**Key Insights:**

The dashboard provides answers to the following business questions:

--Total Sales: Overall revenue generated throughout the year.

--Top 15 Best-Selling Pizzas: Ranked the most popular pizza flavors by sales volume.

--Sales by Month: Showed monthly sales trends to spot peak performance periods.
